# Product Quest Template
Take a look at how to create a 'Product Hunt' like directory with upvoting functionality.

## How to use
1. Open main.js in a text editor and locate the Sheety URL
2. Replace the project URL with your own Sheety URL (make sure *not* to include the sheet name in the URL)
3. Enable 'POST' requests on the "Products" sheet in the Sheety Dashboard
4. Customise as you please!
5. Voila! A directory with upvoting powered by a spreadsheet
